## Introduction

Doubtlessly, this century is the century of advanced technology. Beyond the famous Silicon Valley of California, Seattle has been growing to be one of the biggest tech hubs in the U.S. This fast growing of Seattle leads to an increase in population and eventually leads to a higher demand in housing. A price of a house is affected by many factors such as locations, the footage of the house, the condition, and so on. On the other hand, as a real estate company, people also needs to see whether they should invest in expensive areas with less houses sold or invest in more affordable areas with more houses sold. Therefore, in order for the real estate company to have a better understanding about the home sale market in Seattle or King County in general make a decision on how to properly invest in this market, a data analysis is done on King County home sales data between the period of May 2014 and May 2015.
This analysis also helps the real estate company identify and invest in undervalued houses, sell houses at or greater than its true value, determine whether investing in expensive areas with less houses sold or more affordable areas with more houses sold.
